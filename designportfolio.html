                <p>
                    IMUCP is part of the MUCP course, which is a full-year academic course open to undergraduate
                    students in their final year from all U of T faculties, departments and campuses.<br><br>

                    Students are placed in multidisciplinary teams and matched with a community partner that has
                    identified an existing urban challenge that they would like the students to consult on.
                    Over the course of the academic year, teams research, propose, and ultimately prototype an
                    intervention to address this challenge.

                <p>
                    Urban flyovers are typically constructed to solve mobility challenges in rapidly growing cities.
                    However, the spaces beneath these structures often become neglected, underutilized, or misused, thus
                    becoming urban voids.
                    Our community partner, RannNiti, has identified through their preliminary research that these spaces
                    present both a challenge and an opportunity for the urban realm.
                    Thus, our collaboration aims to exploit this potential by reimagining these voids as dynamic,
                    multifunctional public spaces.<br><br>
                    <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rannniti/?originalSubdomain=in">RannNiti</a> is a
                    multidisciplinary impact and design agency, which works with changemakers from the development,
                    public and legislative sectors in the capacity of impact advisors.
                    Our partnership was focused on understanding local context and creating a mutually viable solution
                    that can be replicated within Pune and outside of it.<br><br>
                    Guided by a field visit in October 2024, coupled with stakeholder interviews and desktop research,
                    we developed <a target="_blank" href="https://theflyoverguide.my.canva.site/">a website guide</a>
                    for creating safe, and inclusive public spaces.
                    It includes an overview of urban voids, <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://mkbs-mkbs2000.github.io/Spaces-Under-Flyover/">case studies from global
                        contexts</a>, and a comprehensive framework that addresses stakeholder engagement, design
                    alternatives, and effective governance.
                    Our deliverable aims to foster community collaboration, municipal awareness, and local
                    entrepreneurship, hence contributing to the broader urban fabric of Pune.

            My key contributions for this group project can be demonstrated in four instances across the project term:

                    <strong>I fostered a friendly and sociable group environment by establishing warm personal relationships
                        with teammates from University of Toronto and Ashoka University.
                    </strong><br>
                    Due to the multidisciplinary and multinational backgrounds of all of our members, there was nothing much
                    that connects us as a group initially. Hence, I took the initiative to introduce myself to each of my U of T 
                    teammates and get to know them better in the first two weeks of the project. During the field trip, which 
                    was where I got to meet my Ashoka teammates in person for the first time, I also made the effort to connect 
                    with them by spending more time with them during meals and breaks. I believed that those interactions allowed
                    me to gain their trust and support as I lead them throughout the year. From those actions, I also got to learn
                    about their working styles and schedules, thus giving me an idea of how best to manage the group as well as my
                    own expectations for the work.

                        of the project term, to discuss and settle on deliverable output type.
                    </strong><br>
                    As I built rapport with my teammates, I then leveraged on my background in GIS and mapping to guide initial
                    discussion within the group on the type of output that we should produce. This was done by using Python to 
                    extract spatial data about locations of flyovers as well as locations of various amenities, and I shared with 
                    them <a target='_blank' href='data\designportfolio\Pune_Trial.html'>my findings</a>. This was meant to provide
                    a visual reference for the group to decide where a suitable flyover revitalisation project could take place
                    and what purposes/amenities should be there in order to make the best use of the space. <br><br>
                    As we were suggested the Paud Road Flyover during the field trip, the relevance of my initial findings become
                    less useful due to the physical restrictions of the space and the limited time that we were there in order to
                    verify the findings or gather new ones. I recognised that we need to adapt our project's direction moving forward. 
                    Hence, after initial discussions with Jake, we proposed to the group for the project to pivot towards a broader 
                    approach of creating a website guide that RannNiti could refer to and establish the right processes that includes 
                    the community to revitalise the spaces under flyovers in Pune, India.

                                Space</i></a> of our website guide.
                    </strong><br>
                    After we have decided to pivot towards developing a website guide, I opted to write the section that discusses
                    governance of the space after it has been activated. This is because it was a natural extension of the research
                    on case studies (see next point) where I would be able to shortlist some of the governance options that are 
                    available based on what is currently being practiced in other successfully revitalised spaces. More often than
                    not, the details on how the space is governed is not easily available in the case studies literature. Thus, in 
                    completing this section, it required me to connect the research on the specific case studies and circumstancial
                    information about how public spaces in those municipalities are governed.

                    <strong>I applied my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://mkbs-mkbs2000.github.io/Spaces-Under-Flyover/">case studies map</a> for our
                        website guide.
                    </strong><br>
                    As the website guide content is developed over the Winter 2025 term, I took the opportunity to apply the web 
                    mapping skills learnt from a course that I took in that same term to present the case studies interactively 
                    instead of simply presenting location features via photos and static maps. This also meant that I was involved
                    in looking up details about the case studies, alongside Jake. Even though the case studies map is developed 
                    separately from the main website guide (which uses less coding as it relies on Canva's website builder), I opted
                    to streamline the design of the case studies map to match the website guide's design as much as possible. The 
                    code used to develop the website can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mkbs-mkbs2000/Spaces-Under-Flyover">here</a>.<br><br>
                    The map itself is currently powered using MapBox, which is a paid web mapping platform that I was exposed to in 
                    <i>GGR472</i>. However, I do intend to work on it beyond the course to replace it with MapLibre, which is an 
                    open-source alternative. This is to ensure that the web map continues to be accessible and not susceptible to
                    paywall features that MapBox may implement in the future.

            Personally, I felt that MUCP was more than just an academic course. It was a valuable experience that allowed me to apply 
            skills learnt from undergraduate studies - Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript - to a real-world project. It also challenged
            me to use my research and inference skills to produce a section of the deliverable that we are producing for our
            community partner. Finally, it also offered a unique opportunity for me to partner with a multidisciplinary and multinational 
            group of students and guide them through an urban planning project.
