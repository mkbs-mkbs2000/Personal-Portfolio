                <p>
                    IMUCP is part of the MUCP course, which is a full-year academic course open to undergraduate
                    students in their final year from all U of T faculties, departments and campuses.<br><br>

                    Students are placed in multidisciplinary teams and matched with a community partner that has
                    identified an existing urban challenge that they would like the students to consult on.
                    Over the course of the academic year, teams research, propose, and ultimately prototype an
                    intervention to address this challenge.

                <p>
                    Urban flyovers are typically constructed to solve mobility challenges in rapidly growing cities.
                    However, the spaces beneath these structures often become neglected, underutilized, or misused, thus
                    becoming urban voids.
                    Our community partner, RannNiti, has identified through their preliminary research that these spaces
                    present both a challenge and an opportunity for the urban realm.
                    Thus, our collaboration aims to exploit this potential by reimagining these voids as dynamic,
                    multifunctional public spaces.<br><br>
                    <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rannniti/?originalSubdomain=in">RannNiti</a> is a
                    multidisciplinary impact and design agency, which works with changemakers from the development,
                    public and legislative sectors in the capacity of impact advisors.
                    Our partnership was focused on understanding local context and creating a mutually viable solution
                    that can be replicated within Pune and outside of it.<br><br>
                    Guided by a field visit in October 2024, coupled with stakeholder interviews and desktop research,
                    we developed <a target="_blank" href="https://theflyoverguide.my.canva.site/">a website guide</a>
                    for creating safe, and inclusive public spaces.
                    It includes an overview of urban voids, <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://mkbs-mkbs2000.github.io/Spaces-Under-Flyover/">case studies from global
                        contexts</a>, and a comprehensive framework that addresses stakeholder engagement, design
                    alternatives, and effective governance.
                    Our deliverable aims to foster community collaboration, municipal awareness, and local
                    entrepreneurship, hence contributing to the broader urban fabric of Pune.

            My key contributions for this group project can be demonstrated in four instances across the project term:

                    <strong>I demonstrated initiative in getting the group to start thinking about our final deliverable output.
                    </strong><br>
                    In the early weeks of the project before our field trip, I leveraged on my background in GIS and mapping to 
                    kickstart initial discussion within the group on the type of output that we should produce. This was done by 
                    using Python to extract spatial data about locations of flyovers as well as locations of various amenities, 
                    and I shared with them <a target='_blank' href='data\designportfolio\Pune_Trial.html'>my initial findings</a>. 
                    This was meant to provide a visual reference for the group to decide where a suitable flyover revitalisation 
                    project could take place and what purposes or amenities should be there in order to make the best use of the 
                    space.

                    <strong>I displayed adaptability when faced with new obstacles that were previously not accounted for.
                    </strong><br>
                    As we were suggested the Paud Road Flyover during the field trip, we realised that it was unfeasible to suggest
                    a specific intervention for the space. This was due to the relatively small space under the flyover - presenting 
                    physical restrictions - on top of our relatively short time on-the-ground, the fact that none of our group 
                    members are residents of Pune, and that we possessed neither engineering nor architectural expertise between 
                    the group and our community partner. I recognised that we need to adapt our project's direction if we wanted to 
                    complete the project and address our community partner's problem statement effectively. Hence, after initial 
                    discussions with another teammate, Jake Karpouzis, we proposed to the group for the project to pivot towards a 
                    broader approach of creating a website guide that RannNiti could refer to and establish the right processes that 
                    includes the community to revitalise the spaces under flyovers in Pune, India.

                    href="https://mkbs-mkbs2000.github.io/Spaces-Under-Flyover/">case studies map</a> for our website guide.
                    </strong><br>
                    I took the opportunity to apply web map development skills learnt from another course to present the case studies 
                    interactively. This is in contrast to simply presenting location features via photos and static maps that have 
                    been featured in similar guides. The code used to develop the website can be found <a target="_blank" 
                    href="https://github.com/mkbs-mkbs2000/Spaces-Under-Flyover">here</a>. While I was responsible for coding, I also 
                    partook in literature review of the case studies alongside Jake in looking up details about the case studies,
                    forming the textual and visual content on the dynamic left panel of the website. Even though the case studies map 
                    is developed separately from the main website guide (which relies on Canva's website builder), I opted to 
                    streamline the design of the case studies webpage to match the website guide's webpage deisign as much as possible.

                    <strong>I leveraged on my research and inference skills as well as knowledge of a different language to

                    Governing Space</i></a> of our website guide.</strong><br>
                    As a natural extension of the research on case studies, I opted to write the section that discusses sustainable
                    governance of the space after it has been activated. This section is largely missing from general current 
                    literature on revitalising urban voids of various kinds. Additionally, when looking at each case study, the 
                    details on how the space is governed is not easily available either. For example, the governance of Taman Film 
                    in Bandung, Indonesia, is not available in English, but rather in Bahasa Indonesia. Thus, to complete this 
                    section, I was required to connect research about the specific case studies to the circumstancial information 
                    about how public spaces in those municipalities are governed, sometimes across different languages, such as for 
                    Taman Film.

        <p>
            Personally, I felt that MUCP was more than just an academic course. It was a valuable experience that allowed me to apply 
            skills that I learnt throughout my undergraduate studies - Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript - to a real-world project. It 
            also challenged me to use my research and inference skills, as well as familiarity with different languages, to produce a
            part of the deliverable. Finally, it also offered a unique opportunity for me to partner with a multidisciplinary and 
            multinational group of students and guide them through an urban planning project.<br><br>

            I am confident that our website guide, with its spotlight on examples from Global North and Global South, as well as the 
            addition of discussion on sustainable governance long after a space has been reactivated, will help RannNiti towards
            achieving their goal of creating a stronger sense of community in Pune by repurposing spaces under flyovers.
